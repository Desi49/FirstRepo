<p>The Excorcist was shot from Augest 14th,1972 to July 20th,1993 but was released on december 26th,1973.A fact about the movie is that a unexplained fire happened on all the sets except for the little girls room.9 people died during the making of the movie. This was a very good movie in my opinion not that scary but i really liked it. My favorite part was when the girl told this guy he was going to die then peed on the carpet.</p>
