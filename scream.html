<p>The scream movies are my favorite thriller movies.They have a diffrent killer everytime you might think you know who it is but you were really wrong.You cant trust anyone in this movie.The orignal name for scream was going to be scary movie but then heard one of the michael jackson songs in there car.My favorite scream movie would have to be the first one and the last one.</p>

  <p>The plot for the movie is based on acutal events that happened in Gainesville,Florida back in the early 90's.Courteney Cox(Gall Weathers) and David Arquette(Dewy) met and fell in love on set then eventually married but divorced in 2013.Stu's line "I always had a thing for ya, Sid!" and Sidney's response "In your dreams!" is a refencences to nightmare on elm street.The director of the Scream movies is also the director of nightmare on elm street and Halloween.The scream mask is based off the painting scream.
